About the Project:
This program is a Java-based implementation of the classic Battleship game, where players compete against a computer opponent. The computer employs a combination of random and strategic guessing, making each game challenging and fun.

Features:
- Place your ships manually with guided instructions.
- The computer strategically places its ships.
- Intelligent gameplay where the computer shifts from random to strategic guesses.
- Visual representation of player and computer battlefields.
- Fully customizable and modular codebase for easy enhancement.

How It Works:
The program is divided into the following key components:
- AddCompShips.java: Handles the computer’s logic for placing ships on the grid.
- AddPlayerShips.java: Guides the player in choosing valid coordinates for placing ships.
- ComputerTurn.java: Manages the computer’s guessing strategy (random at first, strategic after a hit).
- PlayerTurn.java: Allows the player to guess valid coordinates.
- GameBoard.java: Prints the battlefields for both the player and computer.
- Ships.java: Contains ship attributes such as name and size.
- Targets.java: Defines Target objects used during gameplay.

Usage:
1. Run the program.
2. Follow on-screen prompts to place your ships.
3. Take turns with the computer to guess coordinates.
4. Sink all of the opponent’s ships to win the game!
